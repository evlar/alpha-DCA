# 🤖 Alpha DCA - Bittensor Automated Staking Tool

Automate your TAO staking across multiple Bittensor subnets with a user-friendly web interface.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Web UI)

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alpha-DCA.git
cd alpha-DCA
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Start web interface
python3 web_config.py

# Visit http://localhost:5000 in your browser to configure your staking strategy
```

## 💻 CLI Setup (No GUI)

If you prefer command-line setup:

1. Copy the example config:
```bash
cp example.config.yaml config.yaml
```

2. Edit the config file with your preferred editor:
```bash
nano config.yaml  # or vim config.yaml
```

3. Run the DCA script:
```bash
python3 alpha_DCA.py
```

To run in background with PM2:
```bash
pm2 start alpha_DCA.py --name "alpha-dca" --interpreter $(which python3)
pm2 logs alpha-dca  # Monitor logs
pm2 stop alpha-dca  # Stop the process
```

After making changes to `config.yaml`, restart the DCA script:
```bash
# If running directly:
Ctrl+C and run python3 alpha_DCA.py again

# If running with PM2:
pm2 restart alpha-dca
```

## 📈 Allocation Strategy

You can create multiple allocation categories (e.g., "Established", "New-comers", "Shit-coiners") and assign different percentages of your total DCA amount to each. Within each category, distribute the stake across multiple subnets:

```yaml
allocation:
  established:  # 60% of total DCA
    description: Proven subnets with consistent returns
    total_percentage: 90
    subnets:
      '11': 60  # 60% of the 90%
      '64': 40  # 40% of the 90%
  shit_coiners:  # 40% of total DCA
    description: YOLO plays
    total_percentage: 10
    subnets:
      '333': 100  # 100% of the 10%
```
